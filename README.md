# Notes and Tips:

# index.html is usually the initial file
# Use developer tool to review the backend of html web code

# When using CSS, there are multiple ways to style html 
# 1. Inline CSS - where you add the formatting in the html file itself. Downside is that this si very messy/clutters code and inefficient to udpate
# 2. Internal Style Sheet - Where in the header of the html file, you can define the style sheet. Can clutter up code still
# 3. External CSS - Creating a external CSS file that will keep all the styling. (Recommended)
